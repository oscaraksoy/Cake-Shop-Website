1200 px.

**3. DATABASE**
The database has been designed and normalised to keep a record of all the information about a partic-
ular user and a particular product. The database contains 11 tables, each of which stores details about
a particular aspect of the online shop.

cart
The cart table connects the unique cartID which is generated to a particular user.

cartItem
The cartItem table stores all the information about a particular product which the user has added to
the shopping cart.

categories, product_category
The categories table and product_category table links the different categories which a product can
have.

product_type, types
The product_type and types table links the different types which a product can have.

orderitem, userOrder
The orderItem and userOrder table stores information about a particular order and a particular item
which has been ordered once the user press checkout.

transaction
The transaction table is used to record a particular transaction which has taken place after the user has
accepted an order.

user
The user table stores all the information about a particular user including admin users.


**4. INDIVIDUAL REPORT**
I have implemented the **Home** page, **About** page, **Contact Us** page, **Login** Page, **Registration** Page,
**Forget Password** Page, **User Profile** Page, **Admin Panel** Page and **Send Mail To Subscribers** Page.

**Home Page**
The home page has been implemented with HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and AJAX. It is divided in
several parts whereby the user can have a global idea of what the product website is selling with
details about the services offered as well as instructions on how to order on the website. The user also
has an overview of the people involved in the company. These parts have been implemented with
HTML and CSS.

The contact form and newsletter have been implemented with HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and
AJAX. The contact form enables the user to send us a mail on our personal mailbox(malako.cake-
shop@gmail.com). The field validation is done using javascript and once the fields have been validat-
ed, the data is send to a PHP file to be processed using AJAX such that there is no need to reload the
page in order to get a confirmation of the completion of the mail sending process. In order to be able
to send mail, the sendMail.ini and php.ini file in XAMPP folder have been modified such that mails
can be sent from localhost. The code snippet below execute the mail sending process using the ‘mail’
function in PHP:

The newsletter also uses javascript to validate the correct email format and then the data is sent to a
PHP file to be processed using AJAX. The function has been designed in such a way that only regis-
tered users can subscribe to a newsletter. If an invalid email or a non registered email is entered, the
user will be prompted with an appropriate message.

The google map has been integrated using a widget available from developers.google.com. Only the
width and height have been modified to adapt it to our website.


**Include Files**
The sections listed below are all common across all pages. They have been implemented separately
using the **_‘include’_** function in PHP. This prevents the same code from being implemented in each
page making the website more difficult to maintain.

- Contact Us Form
- Newsletter Form
- Google Map
- Navigation Bar
- Mobile Navigation Bar
- Bottom Navigation Bar
- Footer

**About Page**
This page has been implemented with HTML and CSS. It contains more details about the people
involved in the bakery Malako. Information such as bakers, awards and more information about the
CEO of the bakery are available. The contact form and newletter forms are also available here.

**Contact Page**
This contact page contains all the necessary information needed to get in contact with people at
Malako such as google map, contact form and newsletter.

**Login Page**
The login page has been implemented using HTML, CSS and PHP. The form validation and process-
ing are all done on the server side using PHP. The server checks if the username and password combi-
nation corresponds and only after confirmation gives the user access to his account. The function
**_‘checkAccount.php’_** checks if the user is an admin and if he is, he will be redirected to the admin
panel instead of the regular user profile account.

**Forgot Password Page**
The forgot password page has been implemented using HTML, CSS and PHP. All the form valida-
tions and processes are done on the server side using PHP. If the user has forgotten his password or user-
name, using his email address, he can recover both. Once the button ‘RESET PASSWORD’ has been
pressed, the user will receive an email containing his username and a randomized new password.

**Registration Page**
The registration page has been implemented using HTML, CSS and PHP. All the form validations and
processes are done on the server side using PHP. The username and email are checked if they already
exist in the database. If it is the case, an error message is prompted to the user. A google captcha
checkbox is also used to prevent any type of bot attacks on the website. Once all the input have been
validated, the user will receive an email with a link to validate the entered email during registration.
The user will be able to login only after validating his email otherwise an error message will be
prompted if the user tries to login before validating the email.


**User Profile Page**
This page has been implemented with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and PHP. The user can view and edit
his personal information and his password from this page. He can also delete his account from this
page. The input validation are performed on the server side and if the correct input have been entered,
the user can update his profile or change his password. The user is prompted with an appropriate mes-
sage if the data has been successfully updated.

The user can also logout using the logout button.

**Admin Panel Page**
This page has been implemented using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and PHP. Here also the
user can view, edit and update his information including his password and also delete his account. In
addition to these options, an admin can also write and send an email to the subscribers directly from
the website using a rich text editor implemented with JavaScript. The editor has been implemented
using a widget named ‘summernote’ and it has been modified using the code snippet below to add
additional options to the editor.

The mail is sent using the code snippet below in PHP and automatically search for all subscribers in
the database and add them in Bcc to the mail.


**Responsiveness**
This website has been designed in two parts using media queries in the CSS files. All pages have been
designed twice. Once for mobile screen size and once for large screen size.

**Page Access**
In order to prevent anyone from accessing some crucial pages directly from the URL, a function
**_‘checkAccess.php’_** has been designed to give access only to pages which have a constant named 'Access' defined in
the page.

Only pages which have been given access at the appropriate time will be displayed otherwise the page
will display access denied. For example, trying to access **_‘userAccount.php’_** from the URL without
signing in will display the following message: Access Denied!
